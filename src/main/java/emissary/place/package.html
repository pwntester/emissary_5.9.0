     An Emissary system is build up of Places to which a MobileAgent can
     route a payload or collection of payloads. This package contains
     the basics of building a place as well as some basic implementations
     for running command line tools, taking payloads apart into sub
     pieces, runnng Python script tools via Jython, and coordinating the
     execution of multiple other places as an aggregate.
