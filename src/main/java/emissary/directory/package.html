     The Emissary Directory controls the advertisement and availability
     of services (places) in the Emissary system. The directory tracks
     cost and quality of all places that register and propagates that
     information throughout the system. The Directory is a specialized
     implementationof the ServiceProviderPlace, so it can advertise itself
     as well.

     The Directories are connected in a P2P network that utilizes both
     Rendezvous and Relay concepts. A static configuration file of
     initial rendezvous directories is read and these directories
     are monitored and contact is attempted. The current directory 
     attempts both a zone transfer from each rendezvous directory and
     to register itself as a peer with the rendezvous. Upon successful
     zone transfer (see DirectoryXmlContainer for the zone transfer
     format), any foreign keys are evaluated to see if they are also
     peers of the current directory. If so, they are tracked, added
     to the rendezvous peer list and zone transfers from them are 
     attempted in like manner. In this way all of the directories
     in a peer group find each other by the use of one or more
     statically configured rendezvous hosts.

     Directory relay hosts are directories through which other peer
     groups are forced to communicate due to policy or network 
     topology. If a system has a configured relay directory, they will
     be connected to it in a parent-child relationship. The parent
     will proxy keys from itself and its peer group to the child
     group and will proxy keys from the child group to its peer
     group. This forces all communications to come through the directory
     acting as a proxy. The forwarding from the proxy key to the real
     key takes place when the message arrives on the process or 
     processHeavyDuty method.

     Directories are observable for several behaviours. The PeerObserver
     will, when registered, get notice of updates to the peer group list.
     Any time a peer joins or leaves the group the updated list of
     peers will be sent to the observer. The PlaceObserver registers with
     a pattern that receives notice whenever a matching key is added,
     removed, or has its cost changed. See KeyManipulator.gmatch for
     details on the patterns, but in general the normal four-tuple
     keys can be wildcarded. The default pattern, *.*.*.* will match
     every directory entry. The DirectoryObserverManager is the
     mechanism used in the DirectoryPlace to manage communication with
     all of the registered observers.
